# How Starlink Works — an interactive field guide

An independent, editorial explainer of the Starlink satellite network: how the
constellation is arranged, how a request leaves your roof, what the satellite
actually does, where the ground stations fit, and where the milliseconds go. It
includes a real-time 3D model of the orbital shells built from published
altitudes and inclinations.

Built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4 and three.js / React
Three Fiber.

## Pages

| Route | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `#/` | Overview — the four-step signal path, why low orbit wins, laser mesh, handovers, key numbers |
| `#/how-it-works` | Nine-chapter explainer with interactive figures and a scroll-spy chapter rail |
| `#/explorer` | 3D constellation explorer: five views, speed control, layers, satellite inspector, coverage probe |
| `#/numbers` | Orbit sandbox, latency budget and the fibre-vs-space crossover chart |
| `#/faq` | Short answers to the common questions, plus sources |

Routing is hash-based (`#/how-it-works@lasers`), so the built site works from
any static host — including a single file.

## Interactive figures

- **Signal path** — click through uplink → relay → gateway → return, or switch to
  the laser route.
- **Phased array** — drag the beam angle; watch the phase step and timing change.
- **Spot beams** — hover the cells to see how frequency bands are reused.
- **Satellite anatomy** — hover the numbered callouts to inspect the hardware.
- **Coverage map** — click anywhere to count covering satellites in the model.
- **Pass timeline** — plot the elevation of two consecutive satellites and the
  handover between them.
- **Orbit sandbox** — one altitude slider drives speed, period, footprint and
  light time from two-body physics.
- **Latency race** — a transparent light-time model with a visible crossover.

## Accuracy

Figures are approximate and reflect the public record as of **October 2026**.
They change as the constellation grows. Orbital mechanics, footprint geometry,
light-time and the shell table are computed from published parameters
(Earth radius 6,371 km, μ = 398,600.4418 km³/s², c = 299,792.458 km/s).

Two figures deliberately bend scale for legibility and say so in the UI: the
altitude-o-meter compresses the distance to geostationary orbit, and the orbit
sandbox draws altitude 6× exaggerated while computing the footprint from the
true radius and altitude.

The 3D model is **not live telemetry**: satellites are propagated with a simple
circular two-body model from published shell parameters. Distances are to scale
(1 scene unit = one Earth radius); spacecraft are drawn much larger than reality
so they can be seen and clicked. Simplifications are labelled in the UI.
